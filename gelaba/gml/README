GML - GELABA Markup Language

GML is an XML variant to describe XML grammars with restricted
predefined data structures and with an embedded documentation.

GeLaBa provides tools to transform a GML file into a DTD, a W3C XML
Schema, an HTML documentation, and a specialized Python API to
manipulate XML files following a GML definition.

GML is a reflexive language: GML can be described in GML. We have
tried to keep GML simple, for instance, we tried to provide only one
way of expressing content models.

Some files of this directory are generated using 'trang', see:
http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/trang.html
 
This directory contains:

README -- this file
TODO -- GML TODO list
gml.xml -- the GML description of GML
gml.dtd -- the DTD of GML (this file is *NOT* autogenerated now)
gml.rnc -- Relax NG schema, compact syntax (see http://relaxng.org)
gml.rng -- Relax NG schema, XML syntax (see http://relaxng.org)
gml.xsd -- W3C XML schema
xml.xsd -- Generated by 'trang'
schemas.xml -- Files used by Emacs 'nxml-mode' to find the right RNC
file when editing 'gml.xml'.

Makefile -- Used to generate some files, try 'make'. To produce the
files gml.rng, gml.rnc and gml.xsd, try 'make trang'.

**ATTENTION** **WARNING** **READ CAREFULLY**

To update the definition of GML, two files must be edited. This is due
to the fact that the GML definition of GML (gml.xml) is not derived
from the DTD definition of GML (gml.dtd): there is a "chicken and egg"
problem of bootstrap. So, we have to keep in sync 'gml.dtd' and
'gml.xml' by manually editing both.
